# Hello

I'm DRKV. If you're here, you've probably heard of me from some niche video game related community.

- I've worked on a few, relatively popular [Terraria mods](https://github.com/DRKV333/MechTransfer).
- Lately I've been trying to kick-start the [Otherland MMO revese engineering](https://github.com/DRKV333/HappyBug) effort.

I have a bachelor's degree in computer engineering, I'm currently working on my master's degree. I am familiar with variety of different technologies, including:

- C#, .NET, CIL and [XAML based UI technologies](https://github.com/DRKV333/Janki)
- Backend development using ASP.NET Core
- Java and [Java bytecode](https://github.com/DRKV333/ScalingGUIs)
- Low level OpenGL graphics in C/C++
- [SWIG](https://github.com/DRKV333/RakNet), for interfacing C++ code with .NET
- Unity
- Unreal Engine 3/4/5
- [Docker](https://github.com/DRKV333/bareos-docker)
- Obscure languages, such as: UnrealScript, Perl, Prolog
- I also have a little bit of experience with web frontend development.

I am looking for work/internship opportunities. If you need someone who can work with any of these and more, in person in Budapest, or anywhere remotely, please contact me: drkv333@gmail.com
